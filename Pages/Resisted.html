<p> 
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">Despite the burning hunger in your stomach you maintain control and give the woman a pained smile. "I'm fine, thank you." Escapes your lips in a pained rasp and despite a slight flicker of doubt in her eyes she nods and collects her things before moving down the hall.</a>
</p>

<p> 
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">Slamming the door you have to take several deep breaths to keep control. What... what was that? You'd barely been able to resist the urge to launch yourself forward and rip her throat out to... to... drink her blood. What was happening to you.</a>
</p>

<p> 
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">One thing was sure... you couldn't stay here all night.</a>
</p>

<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;" href="Hallway.html">Leave the room after taking a few moments to calm down.</a>
