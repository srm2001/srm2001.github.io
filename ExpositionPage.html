<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">The year is 2021 and Las Vegas is a bustling city full of opportunity for all sorts of people on all sides of the law... and both sides of the grave. Underneath a veil that hides their existence from humans the creatures we know as Vampires eke out existences at every level of society. They keep their existence a secret from humanity for they know that if the herd knew of the monsters in their midsts it wouldn't take long for their species to be exterminated.</a>
</p>
<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">To that end the vampiric race keeps up a "veil" to keep their existence hidden from the humans. While not every Vampire abides or agrees with this law it is the only one in their city that could be considered near-absolute.</a>
</p>
<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">Vampires are a highly varied species made up of several "bloodlines". Each Bloodline seems to represent an archetype of vampiric myth and is likely the origin for these sorts of myths in the first place. These bloodlines are; The Bestia (Vampires as Predators), The Noctis (Vampires as beings of Shadow), The Mortem (Vampires as Necromancers) and The Imperators (Vampires as Nobles). Each of these bloodlines have unique ablitlies and weaknesses alongside the standard traits all members of their species share.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">The only question now is... what sort of monster are you?</a>
