<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">As the guards lead you into the office of the "Boss" you see who had summoned you. A stunningly beautiful dark haired woman in a red dress stood by the window gazing out over the city while sipping from a glass containing a dark red liquid.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">"Welcome Newborn." She said coldly before turning to look at you with an codly angry expression. However at seeing the confusion on your face at the term she used an eyebrow slowly rose on her face. "You... do know what a Newborn is, don't you?"</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">At your answer in the negative she chuckled but it was almost... sadly. "Oh you poor dear... a Newborn is what you are. A newly turned Vampire." She shook her head. "I wondered why a youngling would be so brave to tresspass in my territory. But you're not brave... just ignorant."</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">She sighed and sat down at her desk while giving you a pitying look. "By our laws you are an illegal creation... and should be destroyed." Before you can say anything she raises a hand. "However. I sense potential in you youngling. So... I will make you a deal."</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">"If you deal with a little problem I'm having I will sponsor you in Vampire society. Sound fair?"</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">She then chuckled. "I'm sorry... I've rushed ahead. I'm sure you have questions. Please... ask."</a>
</p>

<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;" href="End.html">"My questions..."</a>
