<h1 style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:40px;text-align:center;">Chapter 3 - The Casino</h1>

<img src="Images/Casino.jpg" alt="Casino" class="center" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;">

<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;" href="CharacterSheet.html">See Character Details</a>

<p> 
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">The Bleeding Rose casino stood in front of you with open doors. Swallowing your nerves you begin to stride towards the open doors to head inside. Hopefully here you will find answers.</a>
</p>

<p> 
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">As you head inside the scent of alcohol and cigarettes fills your nostrils. You glance around and see a sea of people. This place seemed to be very popular. Frowning softly you obeserved the crowd...</a>
</p>

<p id="fixer" style="display:none">
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">As you look around the casino you recognise several of the big names from the local criminal underworld congregating. Seems this places was popular with the big guns... that was very good to know for future work. However... answers first.</a>
</p>

<p id="influence" style="display:none">
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">As you walk in a few heads turn. It seems some people recognise you and you smile slightly at the recognition. A few take some photos and begin gossiping amongst themselves.</a>
</p>

<p id="imperator" style="display:none">
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">While crossing the floor a server accidently slammed into you and spilled drinks down your front. As the poor waiter stammered out an apology a burning fury arouse in your veins. Something primal inside you didn't like that one bit. Staring the waiter in the eyes you feel your hunger grow slightly stronger as something surges up inside you. "Pour the rest of those drinks on your head. That's a fitting punishment." You find yourself saying and with a blank expression the man complied. The thing that had been furious inside you before now purred in contentment at having the humiliation repayed.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a style="font-family:arial;color:red;font-size:20px;">When you head across the floor you are intercepted by two guards. "Come with us." They say roughly while glaring at you. Crossing your arms you ask why and they tell you the boss wants to see you. Glacing around you realise you can't escape these men and nod slowly. Naybe, just maybe, this "boss" might have the answers you seek...</a>
